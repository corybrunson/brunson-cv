%{\sc Research Interests} \\
%I am developing a research program that draws upon mature foundations in algebraic geometry and topology to address needs arising in the analysis of biomedical data of increasingly high volume, dimension, and heterogeneity.
%To maintain rigor and flexibility both mathematical and scientific, the program exerts broad theoretical and methodological experience, entails sustained collaborations with administrative, clinical, biomedical, and statistical experts, and invites involvement by aspiring and early-career researchers.

%As a recitation instructor I guided class discussions and exercises. As an instructor I was responsible for all aspects of the class except a portion of the final exam.
%As a recitation instructor my job was to help students hone their understanding of concepts they'd been exposed to in lecture; class time largely consisted of group work and student presentations of it, while I kept watch for questions to address or correct explanations to confirm. As a full instructor I prepared lesson plans, assignments, and exams; lectured, took questions, and gave exercises in class; graded; and held office hours. I tried always to have some challenges ready for students who wished to take them without letting this supplemental work give them an unfair advantage. In class, I became adept at building my responses out of the correct nuggets within every question or statement from a student. Gradually I've come to appreciate group exercises more than individual and to prefer interesting or counterintuitive problems to word problems that concoct an ``application'' rarely of use to understanding the mathematics itself. I've grown to want my students to shed their shame over being wrong, and to be more argumentative than comfortable, while still learning to be methodical.
%With a faculty co-organizer (Lizette Zietsman), I arranged a seminar series in math modeling featuring faculty in several disciplines. The course has continued, and students have participated in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling each following February.
%\item
%Tutor and supervisor, Math Emporium, 2000--2006
%I worked with groups of students on notes, exercises, and graded work; or with individuals for a few minutes at a time.
%Tutoring took two forms: In the tutoring lab, an environment for group work, we sat with one to four students enrolled in a common course to discuss their notes, homework, or returned graded work in detail; I've always hesitated to provide answers and during this time learned to ask more effective leading questions and encapsulate concepts so that they may ``click'' for students. On the main floor, a more individual work environment, we were expected to address specific questions quickly and encouragingly; within five minutes or so we learned where a student was getting caught up, guided them with a separate example or with leading questions, and made sure they had a next step in mind before stepping away. (We also had to indicate to some students the difference between a specific question and ``How do you do this?''; sometimes the time I'd spend would be helping them pose a specific question, and often that was enough for them to push forward on their own.
